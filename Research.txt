Set up a U-Net Model that performs not far from the Drive U-Net Model with Excessive Augmentations
    - ~.80 vs .826 Mean Dice Coefficient
    - Likely that the difference can be accounted for by Excessive Augmentations.

Measured Different Styles of Uncertainty
    - Dropblock
        - ...
    - Rotational
        - ...
    - Translation
        - No uncertainty b/c UNet should be equivariant due to being fully convolutional
        - We show this in our work
